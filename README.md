# Question: How do you create a scheduler that supports multiple priorities for task execution? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided creates a simple console application that implements a task scheduler with multiple priorities. The application is built around two classes: Task and PriorityQueue. The Task class is used to create new tasks, each with a specific priority and name. The PriorityQueue class is used to manage these tasks. It has an array, 'tasks', to store the tasks, and three methods: enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty. The enqueue method adds a new task to the queue. If the queue is empty, the task is simply added. If not, the method iterates through the existing tasks to find the correct position for the new task based on its priority. The task with the highest priority (represented by the lowest number) is placed at the front of the queue. The dequeue method removes and returns the task at the front of the queue, which will always be the task with the highest priority. The isEmpty method checks if the queue is empty. After tasks are added to the queue, they are executed in order of priority until the queue is empty.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall logic and structure. Both versions use a priority queue to manage tasks and execute them based on their priority. However, there are a few key differences due to the features and capabilities of TypeScript:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript allows for type annotations, which provide a way to enforce certain types of values. In the TypeScript version, the `Task` class constructor has parameters with type annotations (`public priority: number, public task: () => void`). This ensures that the `priority` is a number and `task` is a function.

2. Access Modifiers: TypeScript supports access modifiers (`public`, `private`, and `protected`). In the TypeScript version, the `tasks` array in the `PriorityQueue` class is marked as `private`, which means it can't be accessed directly from outside the class.

3. Class Methods: The TypeScript version introduces a new `Scheduler` class that encapsulates the scheduling and execution of tasks. This class uses a `PriorityQueue` to manage tasks and provides methods to schedule (`scheduleTask`) and execute (`executeTasks`) tasks. This makes the TypeScript version more modular and easier to use.

4. Task Execution: In the JavaScript version, tasks are represented by a name (a string), and the execution of a task is simulated by a console log. In the TypeScript version, tasks are represented by a function (`task: () => void`), and the execution of a task involves calling this function (`task.task()`). This allows for more flexibility and functionality in the tasks that can be scheduled.

5. Strict Equality: TypeScript encourages the use of strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`). This can help prevent bugs due to JavaScript's type coercion. In the TypeScript version, strict equality is used to check if the task queue is empty (`this.tasks.length === 0`).

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a priority queue from the Standard Template Library (STL) to manage tasks, while the JavaScript version manually implements a priority queue using an array. The C++ priority queue automatically sorts the tasks based on their priority, while the JavaScript version has to manually sort the tasks when they are added to the queue.

In the JavaScript version, tasks are represented as objects with a priority and a name. The task execution is simulated by printing the task name and priority to the console. In the C++ version, tasks are represented as objects of classes derived from a base Task class. Each task class has an execute method that is called to execute the task. This demonstrates the use of polymorphism in C++, a feature that JavaScript does not support in the same way.

The C++ version uses pointers to tasks, which allows for the tasks to be of any class derived from the Task base class. This is different from the JavaScript version, where tasks are simple objects with a priority and a name.

In the C++ version, tasks are added to the scheduler with a priority and a pointer to the task object. The scheduler then executes the tasks in order of their priority. In the JavaScript version, tasks are added to the priority queue with a priority and a name, and are then executed in order of their priority.

In summary, the main differences between the two versions are the use of a built-in priority queue and polymorphism in C++, and the manual implementation of a priority queue and the use of simple objects to represent tasks in JavaScript.
